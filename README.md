# Interview-Planner

#**Problem Statement**

When we have an interview coming up, we often visit various coding websites that have endless lists of questions. However, we donâ€™t have the time to go through all of them, and not all questions are relevant. The specific questions asked by the companies we're interviewing with often get lost in the sea of other questions. Additionally, we can't afford to spend too much time on very hard questions. Instead, solving questions that cover the key concepts of other questions can help us be more productive and save time.

#**Motivation & Inspiration**

Everyone is familiar with various online SDE sheets and the issues we face while preparing for the interviews.
All the sheets are prepared with a minimum tenure of 30 Days.
Lack of websites suggesting questions according to the time constraints and Company one is preparing for.

#**Key Features Offered**

1. Company-Based Plan: Filtering questions based on companies.
2. Time-Baed Plan: Planning Questions based on Time Remaining for the interview
3. Updates Dynamically: Get Suggestions for the next  question based on progress
4. List of Plans: Track your daily progress with an interactive interface

#**Future Goals & Aspiration**

1. Prep plan will not only be restricted to coding problems. Addition of MCQs, Aptitude questions, and HR questions to the plan.
2. Introducing a revision feature to provide random questions based on previously solved questions in the plan.
3. Add Interview Experience feature for the student to get an idea of how the interview of a specific company goes.
